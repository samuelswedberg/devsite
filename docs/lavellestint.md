# Summary

This is a freelance job I did for a local small business in the Fargo/Moorhead area. The business
owner is one of my good friends from high school. He came to me asking for a website for his
new tint business that he is starting.


# Key Features

The website primarily is to display services and the work done by Lavelle's Tint to potential
customers. There is an appointment page that sends an email with the filled-out information to
Lavelle's Tint, from which the business can contact the customer from there.

# Initial Design

Below is an image of the wireframe in Figma

The staging environment for the website is can be seen here: [Click me](https://staging.samuelswedberg.com)

The photos are currently placeholders since the business owner has not gotten pictures back to me.
However, I have attached below screenshots of the webpage and initial design of the website.
Again, please excuse the stock photos as they are placeholders currently.

# Reflection

My cover site and previous versions of my older websites were all made in pure HTML, CSS,
and JS. This is the first time I had used a library such as Bootstrap 5. I realized how much easier
the developer experience is with those libraries, however I am still glad I spent a good amount of
time in the mud with CSS styling. The cover site is still made in pure CSS, I basically built up
the sections that Bootstrap and Tailwind give you out of the box.
