# Summary

This is a freelance job I did for a local small business in the Fargo/Moorhead area. The business owner is one of my good friends from high school. He came to me asking for a website for his new tint business that he is starting.

# Key Features

The website primarily is to display services and the work done by Lavelle's Tint to potential customers. There is an appointment page that sends an email with the filled out information to Lavelle's Tint, from which the business can contact the customer from there.

The photos are currently placeholders since the the business owner has not gotten pictures back to me.

# Reflection

My coversite and previous versions of my older websites were all made in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. This is the first time I had used a library such as Bootstrap 5. I realized how much easier the developer experience is with those libraries, however I am still glad I spent a good amount of time in the mud with CSS styling. The coversite is still made in pure CSS, I basically built up the sections that Bootstrap and Tailwind give you out of the box.
