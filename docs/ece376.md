# Summary

This was a term project for my embedded systems course at NDSU. Requirements were to design an embedded system using our PIC board in a group of two, while including at least two interrupts in a meainingful way, and knowledge from at least 3 different lectures. Since we were recreating the CS:GO C4, our additional goals were to make it as accurate to the in game device as possible. Defusing the bomb was not in the scope of the project.

# Requirements

Inputs: Keypad<br>

Outputs: Speaker, Neopixel, Display<br>

Relationship: You enter a keycode into the keypad. If the number is correct, the program will begin the 45 second countdown and periodically send a beep to the speaker at 4231 Hz and a flash to the Neopixel. The display is used to show the numbers the keypad is entering.<br>

Interrupts: Timer0 to set the frequency of the beep, Timer2 to set the duration of the beep & delay.

# Hardware & Software Design

The project consisted of the PIC development board we made in class along with an 8 Ohm speaker, two 100 Ohm resistors, a Neopixel strip, keypad, and jumper wires.

## Flowchart

# Testing & Validation

Speaker plays correct frequency within 1% margin. Keypad entries work to 7 digits as required. Neopixel lights up.
Interrupts are working correctly, playing correct frequency for accurate duration. <br>

We met each of our requirements by using knowledge from Display lecture, Keypad lecture, and Neopixel lecture. We also used Timer0 and Timer2 interrupts in a meaningful way. Our program and hardware follow the flow chart we created.
