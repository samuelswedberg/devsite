# Summary
The inspiration for this project was from a friend of Ben's (co-dev). Ben's friend is training to
become a pilot. He was explaining that he wishes there was an app that when he landed in at an
airport or city, he is not familiar with that would display hotel, restaurant, and other useful data.
This might already exist somewhere on the Internet, however Ben and I both think this would be
a good side project to continue developing skills in full-stack web development.

I have experience in front-end, however I have done very little back-end work. My friend that is
developing this application with me is starting his web developer journey. This will serve as
good practice and experience for the both of us.

# Objectives
The objective in this project is to create a web application that is desktop and mobile friendly to grab tourism data and format it in a way that is easily readable to the user. Currently, I think grabbing data from a Google API, possibly Google Maps, is the best course of action to retrieve useful data. We will take this data and allow the user to format the data in a table, such as sorting by highest rating.

# Stakeholders
- Developers: [Samuel Swedberg](https://github.com/samuelswedberg), [Ben Thompson](https://github.com/benjamin-i-thompson)
- QA: Karson Ferden

# Scope

| Must have     | Nice to have  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Pull from API | User accounts |
| Responsive    | Containerize  |
| Sorting       |               |

# Resources
Front end: Next.js

Back end: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL

API: Google Maps

Deployment: AWS S3

# Timeline
Ideally, we would like to complete this project in a semester's worth of time. We are currently both students so obviously school will take first priority, which will prolong development time.

# Milestones
This is where we will update our progress on the web app. As of writing this, we are waiting to get established in the new semester before starting.
